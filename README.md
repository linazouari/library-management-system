# Library Management System

## Project Description
A simple digital library management system developed using Java and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.  
The system allows adding books and borrowers, borrowing and returning books, and searching for data.

---

## Objectives
- Apply OOP principles:
  - **Encapsulation**: Protect object data (private fields, getters/setters).
  - **Inheritance**: Create specialized classes (e.g., EBook extends Book).
  - **Polymorphism**: Work with different types of books uniformly.
  - **Interfaces**: (Ready to extend if needed).

- Use **Git** and **GitHub**:
  - Manage project versions with commits and branches.
  - Upload and organize the project repository on GitHub.

- Improve problem-solving and logical thinking skills
